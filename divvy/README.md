## Case Study - Divvy Bike Share
#### Analyzing consumer use patterns to grow annual membership
This project is based on a case study prompt created for the Google Data Analytics Certification program on Coursera. In the given prompt, fictional company Cyclistic is a bike sharing company looking to increase profits by converting short-term, casual bike share users to annual members. The data provided for the project is sourced from real-world bike share company Divvy, which operates in Chicago, Illinois. The cleaning and analysis was done in Python primarily using the Pandas library, with Matplotlib used to create data viz.
